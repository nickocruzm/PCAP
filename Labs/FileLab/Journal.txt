User Input...
    The only information provided by a user is the name of a file.
The easiest method is just using the built-in input method. 

Reading in the file...

    We need to open the given file (from usr).

    we need to read every character of the file. 

    increase the count of every character that is read.

    Using a dictionary we can make the characters of the alphabet the keys
so when we read in the character we can use it as the key to increase the value of that key by 1.

    Beware of the case of character. to prevent not counting upper case letters
we just need to pass in the lower case char as the key.


...Can I create the dictionary as I read in the file?
