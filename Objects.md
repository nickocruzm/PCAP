# Classes Inheritance

```python

class A:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

a = A(1)
print(hasattr(a,'A')) # 
```

Raises an exception, "A.__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given"

```python
    
    class Class:
        def __init__(self):
            pass

    # valid assignment is

    obj = Class()
    
```
